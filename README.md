Agentic AI-Based Loan Approval System

This project showcases an intelligent, agent-driven loan approval system that combines machine learning, OCR, and agentic AI to automate the end-to-end loan processing workflow.

Project Overview
Traditional loan processing in banks is slow, manual, and prone to bias. Our system introduces a smarter approach using:

🤖 Agentic AI for autonomous, goal-driven decision-making

📄 OCR to extract information from scanned Aadhaar/PAN/financial documents

🧮 Machine Learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, Neural Networks) to evaluate applicant risk

🌐 A Flask-powered web interface for real-time interaction

Features
Intelligent agent that can approve, deny, or flag applications

Real-time OCR extraction from Aadhaar and PAN cards

Machine learning model integration for risk evaluation

User-friendly front-end with immediate decision display

Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Flask, Scikit-learn / TensorFlow, OCR (Tesseract)

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

Deployment Ready: scalable cloud deployment
